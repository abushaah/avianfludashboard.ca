# avianfludashboard.ca

https://avianfludashboard.ca

The website was developed to publish detected cases, social media concerns, and harmonized data related to avian influenza. It is developed in collaboration with the University of Guelph and Canadian Food Inspection Agency

Throughout development, I worked with PhD students in data science to visualize geographical data collected from social media APIs and learned how to aggregate data with trained AI models. I worked with cybersecurity tools to monitor and ensure the website is secure, and I worked with students and staff in the department of pathobiology to evaluate the websiteâ€™s interface and ensure it is usable by its end-users.

Milestones include prototyping, research, setup, development & implementation, security, and usability.

Softwares that I worked with to develope the website:
  * Figma
  * HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  * RESTful APIs (NodeJS, Express, etc)
  * Data visualization and geographical softwares (ArcGIS ESRI JS API, Dash JS API)
  * AWS Softwares (AWS EC2 servers, Route 53, VPC)
  * Nginx Reverse Proxy, Systemd
  * php server
  * MySQL database
  * Linux
