# avianfludashboard.ca

The website was developed to publish detected cases, social media concerns, and harmonized data related to avian influenza. It is developed in collaboration with the University of Guelph and Canadian Food Inspection Agency.

Throughout development, I worked with PhD students in data science to visualize geographical data collected from social media APIs and learned how to aggregate data with trained AI models. I worked with cybersecurity tools to monitor and ensure the website is secure, and I worked with students and staff in the department of pathobiology to evaluate the websiteâ€™s interface and ensure it is usable by its end-users.

Milestones include prototyping, research, server setup, development & implementation, security, and usability.

Softwares that I worked with to develope the website:
  * Figma
    * Prototypes can be viewed here: https://haifaaabushaaban.wordpress.com/about-my-job-copy/
  * HTML, CSS, JavaScript
    * Front-end
  * RESTful APIs (NodeJS, Express, etc)
    * Back-end
  * Data visualization and geographical softwares (ArcGIS ESRI JS API, Dash JS API)
    * Map Avian Influenza cases and regions
    * GeoJSON file integration featuring polygonal or geometrical boundary data for accurate visualization of states, regions, and provinces
  * AWS Softwares (AWS Elastic Cloud Compute Linux servers, Route 53, VPC)
    * Setup, deployment
    * Setup domain name and SSL
    * Security
  * Nginx Reverse Proxy, Systemd
    * Security headers, compress and cache data sent over the network
    * Automatic site restart upon errors
  * php server
    * To manage the MySQL database
  * MySQL database
    * Store real-time data collected through social media APIs
